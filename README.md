Repo for HireHydrant, created for the Hack Harvard 2016 hackathon at Harvard University.

Proof of concept for an intelligent online portfolio service that responds dynamically to which recruiters are visiting.

Uses Meteor.js, MongoDB, React, FlowRouter, and LinkedIn authentication. Users can create campaigns which target corporations based on public IP address registration ranges and display custom cover letters to employees of those companies who visit the site while on the company network.
